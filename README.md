# knights-travails

Find the shortest possible route for a knight to move from one square to another on a chessboard

## Pre-Project Thoughts:

- Graphs - specifically the shortest path in an unweighted graph
- BFS for graphs
- Big O notation. In this case time complexity is O(N^2) - in the worst case all cells will be visited. Auxiliary space is also O(N^2), because all of the nodes are stored in a queue.
- Dijkstra's algorithm
