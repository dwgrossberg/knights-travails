# knights-travails

Find the shortest possible route for a knight to move from one square to another on a chessboard

---

## Pre-Project Thoughts:

- Graphs - specifically the shortest path in an unweighted graph
- Understanding BFS traversal for graphs
- Big O notation. In this case time complexity is O(N^2) - in the worst case all cells will be visited. Auxiliary space is also O(N^2), because all of the nodes are stored in a queue.

## Post-Project Thoughts:

- Knights Tour different approaches -> Hamiltonian path problems -> Backtracking -> Warnsdorffâ€™s heuristic / algo

- todo:
  board
  localStorage avg. timer counter
